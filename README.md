# othm-Adroit
***Adroit: quick or skillful; adept in action or thought.***

A pure c library based off [Benny's](https://github.com/BennyQBD) [series on modern OpenGL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftiKrP3gW3k&index=1&list=PLEETnX-uPtBXT9T-hD0Bj31DSnwio-ywh). 

This library owes it existance to many great libraries written in C and usable in C that everyone uses from C++.
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

And some libraries that I like the idea of.
* [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
  * This is a header only library and is included in the source. :smiley:

Along with algebra taken from a game jam.
* [Color Bounce by Shual](https://github.com/shua/jams/tree/master/ld26)
